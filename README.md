# Pencil_app

An App to store, share and explore hitokotos.

## Hitokoto

Hitokoto is a word, a sentence, a saying, a conversation and so on that heat your heart and let you feel emotional or rational.

## Introduce

This application uses a backend web API named [pencil_api](https://github.com/Hello-world150/pencil_api) to store data online. 
But the API is not developed fully.

## Build

Just like normal Flutter application, but I did not join the Apple Developer Program, 
so actually it can not be built as iOS or other Apple application by me :).

You can run follow command to build for android(you must have installed flutter SDK):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hello-world150/pencil_app
cd pencil_app
flutter build apk --verbose --split-per-abi
```

You will get some apk file, just like releases page.

## Use

### Download
Go to [release page](https://github.com/Hello-world150/pencil_app/releases/tag/v1.0.0) to download proper apk. 
For not old android phones, you can download [this one](https://github.com/Hello-world150/pencil_app/releases/download/v1.0.0/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk). 
For other editions, please see [that page](https://github.com/Hello-world150/pencil_app/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

### Install
Now you have an android package file (apk). Just put it into your android phone any normal directory. And tap it, android system will install it automagically.
